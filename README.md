# Project Title

The Organic Awakens

## Overview

The Organic Awakens is an interactive educational tool designed to enhance users' understanding of organic chemistry concepts, including naming compounds, identifying functional groups, and understanding reaction mechanisms through engaging gameplay.

### Problem Space

Many students find organic chemistry concepts challenging, leading to a lack of motivation and understanding. Traditional learning methods can be tedious, making it difficult for students to retain important information. This game aims to make learning organic chemistry enjoyable and effective by offering a fun platform for quizzes and interactive learning.

### User Profile

- Students: High school and college students studying organic chemistry who want to improve their knowledge and test their understanding.

- Educators: Teachers looking for supplementary materials to help students grasp organic chemistry concepts.

### Features

- Quiz Mode:

  - As a user, I want to take multiple-choice quizzes on naming organic compounds, identifying functional groups, and predicting reaction outcomes.
  - As a user, I want to choose between high-school level and college-level quizzes.
  - As a user, I want to see a succinct explanation for both correct and incorrect answers.

- Flashcard Mode:

  - As a user, I want to study key organic chemistry terms and concepts through digital flashcards, with each card including examples of reactions and structures.
  - As a user, I want to see related questions to the content on the flashcards.

- Interactive Molecule Visualizer:
  - As a user, I want to visualize organic molecules in a 3D interactive tool.
  - As a user, I want to have information about the molecules, including functional groups and properties.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript XML
- MySQL
- Express
- Client libraries:
  - react
  - react-router
  - axios
  - JSmol.js and react-molviewer for molecule visualization.
- Server libraries:
  - knex
  - express

### APIs

- No external APIs will be used for the initial version, but local data will be stored in a JSON file.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14+ recommended)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

- Clone the Repository:

**Client**

```
  git clone https://github.com/brunasfenandes/the-organic-awakens.git
  cd the-organic-awakens
```

**Server**

```
  git clone https://github.com/brunasfenandes/the-organic-awakens-server.git
  cd the-organic-awakens
```

### Configure Environment Variables

- Create a .env file in the server and client directories with these variables:

**Client/.env**

```
  VITE_PORT=8080
  VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost
```

**Client/.env**

```
  PORT=8080
  BACKEND_URL=http://localhost
```

## Running the Application

- Backend: In the server directory:

```
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: In the client directory:

```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

- Access the application: Open the localhost in your browser.

- Navigate through the game modes: Quiz Mode, Flashcard Mode, and Molecule Visualizer.

## Data

- Quiz and Flashcard Data: Stored in JSON files, each representing groups of questions and flashcards for different topics.

### Sitemap

- Home Page: Introduction and navigation to game modes.
- Quiz Mode: Multiple-choice questions.
- Flashcard Mode: Interactive flashcards for studying.
- Molecule Visualizer: Interactive tool for visualizing molecules.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between the data points. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out.

### Endpoints

**GET /questions**

- Retrieves a list of questions.

Response:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is the name of the compound?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"],
    "correctAnswer": "Option A"
  }
  ...
]
```

**GET /flashcards**

- Retrieves a list of flashcards containing questions.

Response:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "topic": "Functional Groups",
    "content": "A functional group is what we call specific groupings of certain atoms within molecules that have their own characteristic properties. Here are some of the most commonly encountered functional groups..."
  }
  ...
]
```

## Roadmap

- Create client

  - Set up a React project with routes and basic pages

- Create server

  - Set up an Express server with routing and placeholder 200 responses

- Create migrations
